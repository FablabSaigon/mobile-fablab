1) Become a local partner. In each city we are looking for a local partner to help us with: 
Call for challenges
Call for participants
Logistics support (venue for the event, accommodation, etc.)

2) Help us with our <a href="https://igg.me/at/1xYUqgXCs-8">crowdfunding campaign</a> on Generosity! Help us to spread the word.

3) Join us as a volunteer. Thereâ€™s a lot of work to put together this program: from acquiring a truck, to reaching out to the network, building a website, preparing marketing collaterals, running the bootcamp, we always welcome helping hands!

=Thanks to those who already donated!
